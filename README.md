# SparklingClearners
Web application for cleaners company which is linked to the database to store details, was done as a project in Master's degree. For this project to run you need to import the database (SparklingCleaners.sql) that I have included in this project folder. I used phpMyAdim to create and store database and WAMP server to set up server locally on my windows to create dynamic web application with Apache, PHP and MySQL database.
